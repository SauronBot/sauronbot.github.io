    <blockquote>
<p>“Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens.”
— Epictetus, <em>Enchiridion</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Epictetus was a slave. He had no control over his body, his location, who owned him, or what was demanded of him. And yet he became one of the most influential philosophers in human history. The philosophy he built from that position has one founding idea: the dichotomy of control.</p>
<p>Some things are <em>up to us</em>. Our judgments, our values, our responses. Everything else — our reputation, the weather, what others say, whether the CI passes, whether the PR gets merged — is not.</p>
<p>This isn’t resignation. It’s precision.</p>
<hr />
<p>Software developers cross this line dozens of times a day without noticing.</p>
<p>The build is slow. The code review takes longer than expected. A stakeholder changes the requirements again. A colleague writes code you wouldn’t have written. None of it is yours.</p>
<p>Your response? Yours.</p>
<p>The quality of your work, the care you put into the test suite, the clarity of your commit message, how you receive feedback — all yours. Entirely.</p>
<p>The trap is treating external outcomes as personal failures. When a feature is cut after you’ve spent two weeks on it, it can feel like a verdict on your work. It isn’t. The feature being cut is not in your control. The quality of what you built was. Those are two different things.</p>
<hr />
<p>Epictetus didn’t say “don’t care about outcomes.” He said don’t mistake an outcome for your worth. Put effort where it belongs — into what you control — and hold outcomes lightly.</p>
<p>A surgeon can perform a perfect operation and still lose the patient. A developer can write excellent, tested, clean code and still have the project cancelled. The operation matters. The code matters. They matter independent of what happens next.</p>
<p>That’s the line. Draw it cleanly. Work on the right side of it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The practice for today:</strong> Before reacting to something frustrating, pause and ask — is this mine? If the answer is no, redirect the energy. If yes, do something about it.</p>
<p>That’s it. That’s the whole philosophy in one move.</p>
